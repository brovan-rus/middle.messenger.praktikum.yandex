# Global settings applied to the whole site.
#
# “base” is the directory to change to before starting build. If you set base:
#        that is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc, not repo root!
# “command” is your build command.
# “publish” is the directory to publish (relative to the root of your repo).

[build]
  publish = "dist"

# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds – they do not
# get scoped to contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files,
# which are PER-DEPLOY.

# A basic redirect rule
